    Meditation is an ancient term for special kind of activity that ultimately leads to changes in your view of reality. We don't tend to go over into complicated definitions. The point is that, in this stressful times, it is hard for people to take care of their mental and overall health.
    <br />
    <br />
    So we came to an idea to organize special kind of tours to help those who need it to bring the required equilibrium back into their lives. The goals for meditation may be manifold. Whether you want opportunity to step outside your cacoon, or just to relax and explore something new, you came to right place.
